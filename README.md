# Quiz Board
#### This is a quiz board created using J Query, 2018
#### By Florence Kong'ani
## Description
This is a quiz board with a set of questions that have multiple answers to choose from. The user checks the correct answer from the multiple choices for each question, and clicks the submit button to go to the next question. Once done, a score is shown and the user can then decide whether to take the quiz again. The questions here are intended to test the user's basic knowledge of JavaScript.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
There are no installation requirements for this quiz board. To create the board;
* I set up the structure in the index.html file. I created divs to hold the questions and the results.
* I created jQuery functions in the script.js file to generate the quiz, accept submissions and show the results
* Once the user clicks the submit button for question 5, the score is shown
* If the user wants to take the quiz again, s/he is taken back to question 1
